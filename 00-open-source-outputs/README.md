#### Purpose

- Outputs exist to support you in owning your learning by enabling the exchange of feedback. 
- "Open Source Outputs" exist because we know that you create things every day of your learning journey that are not captured in the current Learning Map.

#### Instructions

In your personal branch, make a copy of the `outputs-template.md` file (located in this same folder), fill it out with the details of your "open source output", and submit it to feedback providers via a pull request.
