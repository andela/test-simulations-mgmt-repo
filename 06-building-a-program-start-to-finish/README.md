### What
This is a sample submission for Outputs 2.0 to enable DOA Fellows produce small incremental and iterative outputs that allow them fulfil the requirements for current CP1 on any project of their choice.

### Why
This would allow facilitators review these produced outputs in bits with clear guidelines on evaluation. This is meant to support scaling the number of fellows facilitators can handle and also help the Learning Department leverage the fellowship at large for evaluation.

It is envisioned that the outputs for this Supercontext would move to pre-fellowship.

### How 
- Fellows are to create two branches off their Facilitator's branch with these naming conventions:
  - `<facilitator>-<team>-<fellow username (without 'andela-')>` e.g. `bayo-izanagi-oagunbiade`. This will be your working branch.
  - `<facilitator>-<team>-<fellow username (without 'andela-')>-output` e.g. `bayo-izanagi-oagunbiade-output`
- For output submissions, fellows are to create a folder called `output` inside the folders for each context. The submissions will then be placed in the output folders for each context e.g. links to Documents, Pull Requests, Screencasts...
- Fellows will then create PRs to their `output` branches and add their Facilitators as reviewers.
- Facilitators will then review, leave comments if necessary and accept or request changes if necessary.
- The fellow is deemed to have completed that output once the PR is accepted and merged.
